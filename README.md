- 👋 Hi, I’m @rockween
- 👀 I’m interested in anything that helps my fellow IT professionals by finding the right opportunities for them that can change their lives.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning latest tech trends
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with developers to learn about the latest tech trends, so I can efficiently recruit developers outside this group.
- 📫 How to reach me via email
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Despite having an IT degree and spending a decade as a systems engineer, I somehow managed to avoid the allure of becoming a developer. Now, after another decade in recruitment, I've decided it's finally time to embrace the mysterious ways of the developer and learn their secrets to recruit them effectively!
